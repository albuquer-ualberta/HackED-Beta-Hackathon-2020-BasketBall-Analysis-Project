We have inbuilt Machine Learning tools that perform career analysis for players and predict their performance for the future.
Our Machine Learning tools are easy to use and allow quick analysis of player data within any of their statistics. 
We have also used statistics analytical tools like percentile, inter-quartile range, outlier exclusion and histogram creations for better analytics and results.
Our tools make it easy to get immediate analysis on the most recent data to as far back as the data exists!
